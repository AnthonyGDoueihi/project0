# Tic Tac Toe and Minesweeper

## Project 0

[The Link to the Project](https://anthonygdoueihi.github.io/project0/)

A HTML, CSS , Javascript and jQuery project. An in browser of game site with Tic Tac Toe, Minesweeper and an incomplete 2048.
The Tic Tac Toe has AI and the ability to change the image of your X or O. The Minesweeper has customisable size and randomly generates the field each time.

I would like to finish 2048 and potentially add SVG animations to the games. I would also like to create an online VS mode.
